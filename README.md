# Javascript

Programming language of the `Web`.

Javascript can change `HTML` content.

Javascript accepts both double quotes `""` and single quotes `''`.

### Data Types
```javascript
var name = "Kirankumar"            # String
var age = 25                       # Number | Integer
var weight = 70.5                  # Number | Float
var ismale = true                  # Boolean
var x = null             
var array = [5, "Hi", true, 7.7]   # Object
```

### What is Hoisting ?
- `Default` bahaviour of Javascript where all the `Variables` and `Functions` declarations are moved on the top. 

### Difference between "==" and "==="

```javascript
var x = 2;
var y = "2";
`x == y`    # Return True since x and y are same.
`x === y`   # Return False since typeof(x) is "Number" and typeof(y) is "String".
```
